# numbers_guessing_game
This is a simple guessing game where the user chooses how many guesses they want. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 10 and the user must guess the number within their number of guesses to win. If they guess the number before they use up all their guesses, a message displays informing them that they guessed the correct number. If they do not guess the correct number and run out of guesses, a message will display what the secret number was.
